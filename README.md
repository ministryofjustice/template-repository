# Ministry of Justice Template Repository

Use this template to [create a repository] with the default initial files for a Ministry of Justice Github repository, including:

* The correct LICENSE
* Github Action example
* A .gitignore file
* A CODEOWNERS file
* A dependabot.yml file

Once you have created your repository, please:

* Edit the copy of this README.md file to document your project.
* Grant permission/s to the appropriate MoJ team/s with at least one team having Admin permissions.
* Try not to add individual users to the repository, instead use a team.
* To add an Outside Collaborator to the repository follow the guidelines on the [GitHub-collaborator repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators).
* Ensure branch protection is set up on the main branch.
* Modify the CODEOWNERS file and state the team or users that can authorise PR's. 
* Modify the Dependabot file to suit the [dependency manager](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#package-ecosystem) you plan to use and for [automated pull requests for package updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/enabling-and-disabling-dependabot-version-updates#enabling-dependabot-version-updates). Dependabot is enabled in the settings by default.
* Modify the short description found on the right side of the README.md file.
* Ensure as many of the [GitHub Standards](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-repository-standards) rules are maintained as possibly can.
